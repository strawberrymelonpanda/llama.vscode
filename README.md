- Display performance stats

## Installation

### VS Code extension setup

Install the [llama-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ggml-org.llama-vscode) extension from the VS Code extension marketplace:

Note: also available at [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ggml-org/llama-vscode)

### `llama.cpp` setup

The plugin requires a [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) server instance to be running at the configured endpoint:

<img width="508" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cc40392-a92c-46df-8a4d-aa762c692ad7" />

#### Mac OS

```bash
brew install llama.cpp
```

#### Windows

```bash
winget install llama.cpp
```

#### Any other OS

Either use the [latest binaries](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases) or [build llama.cpp from source](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/build.md). For more information how to run the `llama.cpp` server, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.vscode/wiki).

### llama.cpp settings

Here are recommended settings, depending on the amount of VRAM that you have:

- More than 16GB VRAM:

  ```bash
  llama-server --fim-qwen-7b-default
  ```

- Less than 16GB VRAM:

  ```bash
  llama-server --fim-qwen-3b-default
  ```

- Less than 8GB VRAM:

  ```bash
  llama-server --fim-qwen-1.5b-default
  ```

<details>
  <summary>CPU-only configs</summary>

These are `llama-server` settings for CPU-only hardware. Note that the quality will be significantly lower:

```bash
llama-server \
    -hf ggml-org/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Q8_0-GGUF \
    --port 8012 -ub 512 -b 512 --ctx-size 0 --cache-reuse 256
```

```bash
llama-server \
    -hf ggml-org/Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-Q8_0-GGUF \
    --port 8012 -ub 1024 -b 1024 --ctx-size 0 --cache-reuse 256
```
</details>

You can use any other FIM-compatible model that your system can handle. By default, the models downloaded with the `-hf` flag are stored in:

- Mac OS: `~/Library/Caches/llama.cpp/`
- Linux: `~/.cache/llama.cpp`
- Windows: `LOCALAPPDATA`

### Recommended LLMs

The plugin requires FIM-compatible models: [HF collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/ggml-org/llamavim-6720fece33898ac10544ecf9)

## Examples

Speculative FIMs running locally on a M2 Studio:

## Implementation details

The extension aims to be very simple and lightweight and at the same time to provide high-quality and performant local FIM completions, even on consumer-grade hardware.

- The initial implementation was done by Ivaylo Gardev [@igardev](https://github.com/igardev) using the [llama.vim](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.vim) plugin as a reference
